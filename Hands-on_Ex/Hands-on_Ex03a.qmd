## 1. Getting started

### 1.1 Installing and loading the required libraries

In this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.
-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for 'ggplot2'.
-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.
-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, 
               patchwork, DT, tidyverse)
```

### 1.2 Importing data

For the purpose of this exercise, a data file called *Exam_data* will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.

The code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## 2. Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods

[ggiraph](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/index.html) is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.

Interactive is made with [**ggplot geometries**](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/reference/index.html#section-interactive-geometries) that can understand three arguments:

-   **Tooltip**: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.
-   **Onclick**: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.
-   **Data_id**: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.

If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this [article](https://www.ardata.fr/ggiraph-book/selections.html) for more detail explanation.

### 2.1 Tooltip effect with *tooltip* aesthetic

Below shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using **ggiraph** package.

By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(
    aes(tooltip = ID),
    stackgroups = TRUE, 
    binwidth = 1, 
    method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, 
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618
)
```

Notice that two steps are involved.

-   First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. [`geom_dotplot_interactive()`](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/reference/geom_dotplot_interactive.html)) will be used to create the basic graph.

-   Then, [`girafe()`](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/reference/girafe.html) will be used to generate an svg (scalable vector graphics) object to be displayed on an html page.

### 2.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip

The content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.

By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.

```{r}
exam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(     
  "Name = ", exam_data$ID,         
  "\n Class = ", exam_data$CLASS)) 

p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(
    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), 
    stackgroups = TRUE,
    binwidth = 1,
    method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 8,
  height_svg = 8*0.618
)
```

The first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in `ID` and `CLASS` fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.

### 2.3 Customising Tooltip style

Code chunk below uses `opts_tooltip()` of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.

```{r}
tooltip_css <- "background-color:white; #<<
font-style:bold; color:black;" #<<

p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(              
    aes(tooltip = ID),                   
    stackgroups = TRUE,                  
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") +               
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(                                  
  ggobj = p,                             
  width_svg = 6,                         
  height_svg = 6*0.618,
  options = list(    #<<
    opts_tooltip(    #<<
      css = tooltip_css)) #<<
)                                        
```

Notice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold. Refer to [Customizing girafe objects](https://2%20%20Customizing%20girafe%20animations) to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.

### 2.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip

Code chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.

```{r}
tooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {
  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)
  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)
  paste("Mean maths scores:", mean, "+/-", sem)
}

gg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
                   aes(x = RACE),
) +
  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, 
                   tooltip = after_stat(  
                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  
    fun.data = "mean_se", 
    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  
    fill = "light blue"
  ) +
  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),
    fun.data = mean_se,
    geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2, size = 0.2
  )

girafe(ggobj = gg_point,
       width_svg = 8,
       height_svg = 8*0.618)
```

### 2.5 Hover effect with data_id aesthetic

Code chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely `data_id`.

Interactivity: Elements associated with a `data_id` (i.e `CLASS`) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(           
    aes(data_id = CLASS),             
    stackgroups = TRUE,               
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") +               
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(                                  
  ggobj = p,                             
  width_svg = 6,                         
  height_svg = 6*0.618                      
)                                        
```

### 2.6 Styling hover effect

In the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(              
    aes(data_id = CLASS),              
    stackgroups = TRUE,                  
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") +               
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(                                  
  ggobj = p,                             
  width_svg = 6,                         
  height_svg = 6*0.618,
  options = list(                        
    opts_hover(css = "fill: #202020;"),  
    opts_hover_inv(css = "opacity:0.2;") 
  )                                        
)                                        
```

Note: Different from previous example, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.

### 2.7 Combining tooltip and hover effect

There are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(              
    aes(tooltip = CLASS, 
        data_id = CLASS),              
    stackgroups = TRUE,                  
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") +               
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(                                  
  ggobj = p,                             
  width_svg = 6,                         
  height_svg = 6*0.618,
  options = list(                        
    opts_hover(css = "fill: #202020;"),  
    opts_hover_inv(css = "opacity:0.2;") 
  )                                        
)                                        
```

### 2.8 Click effect with onclick

`onclick` argument of ggiraph provides hotlink interactivity on the web.

The code chunk below shown an example of `onclick`.

```{r}
exam_data$onclick <- sprintf("window.open(\"%s%s\")",
"https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Primary%20school",
as.character(exam_data$ID))

p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(              
    aes(onclick = onclick),              
    stackgroups = TRUE,                  
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") +               
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(                                  
  ggobj = p,                             
  width_svg = 6,                         
  height_svg = 6*0.618)                                        
```

## 3. More interactive plots

### 3.1 Coordinated Multiple Views with ggiraph

Coordinated multiple views methods has been implemented in the data visualisation below.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(              
    aes(data_id = ID,
        tooltip = CLASS),              
    stackgroups = TRUE,                  
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") +  
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)

p2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(              
    aes(data_id = ID,
        tooltip = CLASS),              
    stackgroups = TRUE,                  
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)

girafe(code = print(p1 + p2), 
       width_svg = 6,
       height_svg = 3,
       options = list(
         opts_hover(css = "fill: #202020;"),
         opts_hover_inv(css = "opacity:0.2;")
         )
       ) 
```

Notice that when a data point of one of the dotplot is selected, the corresponding data point ID on the second data visualisation will be highlighted too.

In order to build a coordinated multiple views as shown in the example above, the following programming strategy will be used:

1.  Appropriate interactive functions of **ggiraph** will be used to create the multiple views.
2.  *patchwork* function of [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) package will be used inside girafe function to create the interactive coordinated multiple views.

### 3.2 Interactive Data Visualisation - plotly methods!

Plotly’s R graphing library create interactive web graphics from ggplot2 graphs and/or a custom interface to the (MIT-licensed) JavaScript library plotly.js inspired by the grammar of graphics. Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.

![](images/image2.jpg)


There are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:

-   by using *plot_ly()*, and
-   by using *ggplotly()*

### 3.3 Creating an interactive scatter plot: plot_ly() method

The tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using `plot_ly()`.

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
             x = ~MATHS, 
             y = ~ENGLISH)
```

### 3.4 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method

In the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. `RACE`).

```{r}
plot_ly(data = exam_data, 
        x = ~ENGLISH, 
        y = ~MATHS, 
        color = ~RACE)
```

Interactive: Click on the colour symbol at the legend.


### 3.5 Creating an interactive scatter plot: ggplotly() method

The code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using `ggplotly()`.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
            aes(x = MATHS,
                y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))
ggplotly(p)
```

Notice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is `ggplotly()`.

### 3.6 Coordinated Multiple Views with plotly

The creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:

-   [`highlight_key()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plotly/versions/4.9.2/topics/highlight_key) of **plotly** package is used as shared data.
-   two scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.
-   lastly, [*subplot()*](https://plotly.com/r/subplots/) of **plotly** package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.

```{r}
d <- highlight_key(exam_data)
p1 <- ggplot(data=d, 
            aes(x = MATHS,
                y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))

p2 <- ggplot(data=d, 
            aes(x = MATHS,
                y = SCIENCE)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))
subplot(ggplotly(p1),
        ggplotly(p2))
```

Click on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.

Things to learn from the code chunk:

-   `highlight_key()` simply creates an object of class [crosstalk::SharedData](https://rdrr.io/cran/crosstalk/man/SharedData.html).\
-   Visit this [link](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) to learn more about crosstalk.

## 4. Interactive Data Visualisation - crosstalk methods!

[Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/index.html) is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).

### 4.1 Interactive Data Table: DT package

-   A wrapper of the JavaScript Library [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)

-   Data objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library 'DataTables' (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).

```{r}
DT::datatable(exam_data, class= "compact")
```

### 4.2 Linked brushing: crosstalk method

```{r}
d <- highlight_key(exam_data) 
p <- ggplot(d, 
            aes(ENGLISH, 
                MATHS)) + 
  geom_point(size=1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))

gg <- highlight(ggplotly(p),        
                "plotly_selected")  

crosstalk::bscols(gg,               
                  DT::datatable(d), 
                  widths = 5)        
```

Things to learn from the code chunk:

- `highlight()` is a function of **plotly** package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.

- `bscols()` is a helper function of **crosstalk** package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. **Warning:** This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.

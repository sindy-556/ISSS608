## 1. Getting started

Loading tidyverse into r environment by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, psych)
```

## 2. Importing data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### About the data

-   Year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school.

-   There are a total of seven attributes. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

    -   The categorical attributes are: `ID`, `CLASS`, `GENDER` and `RACE`.
    -   The continuous attributes are: `MATHS`, `ENGLISH` and `SCIENCE`.

## 3. R Graphics VS ggplot

First, let us compare how R Graphics, the core graphical functions of Base R and ggplot plot a simple histogram.

::: panel-tabset
### R Graphics

```{r}
hist(exam_data$MATHS)
```

### ggplot2

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

## 4. Grammar of Graphics

Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring [mathematical and aesthetic]{style="color:blue"} elements into a meaningful graph.

There are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:

-   Graphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements
-   Meaningful plots through aesthetic mapping

A good grammar of graphics will allow us to:

1.  Gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978).
2.  Provide a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics.
3.  Guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like.

*Note: there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.*

## 5. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: data

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=exam_data) # ggplot() initializes a ggplot object.
# output:A blank canvas


# Aesthetic mappings
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS))
# output: ggplot that includes the x-axis and the axisâ€™s label.
```

## 6. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom

Geometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:

![](images/image6.png){width="80%"}

-   A plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the **+** operator.

-   For complete list, please refer to [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms).

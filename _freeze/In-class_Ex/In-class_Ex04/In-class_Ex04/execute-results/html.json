In contrast, ridgeline plots illustrate the underlying density, highlighting features like multiple peaks (as seen in classes 3G and 3H) and outliers (evident in class 3F). Combining both gives you a more complete view by showing both the summary metrics and the detailed distribution.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create the combined plot\nggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS)) +\n  # Ridgeline layer to show density distributions with semi-transparency\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 1.1,        # Adjusts the vertical scaling of the ridgelines\n    alpha = 0.5,        # Sets transparency so that underlying layers remain visible\n    fill = \"lightblue\"  # Optional: set a fill color for the density areas\n  ) +\n  # Boxplot layer to show summary statistics\n  # position_nudge is used to slightly shift the boxplots so they don't completely overlap with the ridgelines\n  geom_boxplot(\n    width = 0.15,\n    position = position_nudge(y = -0.2),  # Adjust this value as needed\n    outlier.colour = \"red\",              # Highlight outliers, if desired\n    alpha = 0.7                          # Adjust transparency if needed\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Combined Plot of English Scores by Class\",\n    x = \"English Score\",\n    y = \"Class\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](In-class_Ex04_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
